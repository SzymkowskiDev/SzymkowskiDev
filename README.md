# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I offer over 3 years of commercial experience in the data science and software engineering industry. My programming languages are Python and R. In these two ecosystems, I have developed APIs, built analytics dashboards, and written numerous scripts for data transformations. I am also experienced in both relational database design and SQL queries. Before settling down on the backend, I used to be a mobile app developer with React Native, as a result, I am also familiar with front-end technologies. I have acted as SCRUM master in different teams.
